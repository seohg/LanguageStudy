##Backgrounds
The words in the studying language book are not useful in real life. And there are not many opportunities to access new languages in daily life. Language skill is improved only when users continue to learn and pronounce with their eyes and ears, but it is not easy to encounter new languages around us.

##Goal & Target user
1) Goal
• Making people more active, easy, and fun to study words.
• Providing an opportunity to get acquainted with words of the language that users want to learn.
2) Target User
• Children who are experiencing studying new languages.
• Children who don't want to study languages with books.
• Children who want to study with my own objects.


##Key features of the implemented application

• Research method : User Test
• User opinion
“When asked if the application would be useful for learning Spanish words, it said it would be useful for learning the language for the first time because it could learn the words of real things, but it seems not enough to do deep learning “
• Total evaluation
There are cases where the picture quality is not good and
object recognition is not possible, but feedback was obtained that it would be useful for students who start studying Spanish because it is accessible and intriguing.

##Limitations & Future study
1) Limitation
• We can only learn to take pictures yourself
• When supporting a lot of words, fps slowed
down, making it difficult to provide enough
words.
2) Future study
• Supporting languages other than Spanish.

##Conclusion
Our system induces people to actively participate in learning Spanish word. Finding the objects that users want to know and taking a picture of the objects help them actively participate and interest in learning words.
